# Report 1: The "Mincer Equation" thirty years after Schooling, Experience, and Earnings (Lemieux, T.)

## What is the research question of the article?

In this paper, Lemieux asses the validity of the Mincer equation after being for thirty years the most accurate way to obtain the "true" earnings equation. This empirical equation is defined as follows: \
$log \gamma_1$ = $log \gamma_0$ + $rS$ + $\beta_1 X$ + $\beta_2 X^2$  ,\
where $\gamma$ is earnings, $S$ is years of schooling and $X$ is years of potential experience.\
It is considered as a good approximation to real equation because of its parsimonius modeling and its empirical application in a large number of contexts. 

In addition, new parametric and non-parametric procedures have been developed to perform better estimations using modern statistical methods and more data. In this paper, the author focuses on checking the robustness of the original Mincer equation (1974) using new tools, methods of estimation, and data. Is Mincer specification still useful in today's world?

## What are the strengths and weaknesses of the article in order to answer the question?

The main strength of the article is the review of the three variables in the standar Mincer equation using new data (1980-2000).

He begins with the dependent variable and the usage of log of earnings, and taking in consideration that the Mincer equation tries to explain the multiplicative effect of schooling in earnings, we can't use the level of earnings, otherwise the regression would say nothing. 

Then, the author desagrees with the linear specification for years of schooling. First, he demonstrates that educational credentials (high school, 11 years; college, 16 years) breaks the linearity in years of schooling. New information from Mincer (1997) and DeschÃªnes (2001) confirms a strong convexity in the schooling-earnings relationship, due to the effect of college credentials seen in the data. Another way to approach this problem is from the market labor (Mincer 1997, Becker 1975): only when relative demand of labor is matched by corresponding growth in supply, is possible to use a linear relation; empirically, the labor supply doesn't meet the demand instantaneously and this explains the high return rate in the years of college graduation.

The measure of experience in the Mincer equation is in a quadratic function of potential years of experience, following the human capital model that states the decreasing return of education over time. Empirically, the quadratic function does not capture the earning growths in early years as well as a quartic function does, due to the lack of flexibility. This is the reason why a higher order polynomial fits better to potential experience.

The main weakness of the article is the high dependence in features of cohorts. As it is explained in the paper, the original Mincer equation worked well using data from the 1960 Census, in which the next generation had more years of schooling that the last one, and the labor market supply could match the demand of better trained workers. But since the 60's, the years of schooling has not increased as the labor market demand, and this affects our estimation if we are using a standar Mincer equation.

Additionally, the addition of other data besides men from developed countries would help to give a conclusive statement about the external validity of the Mincer equation. 

## Does the article contribute in its academic field? If not, why did editors decide to publish it?

Yes, it does. The paper advices to labor researchers some modifications to do in the Mincer model if they are using it with more recent data. Taking these considerations would them to obtain better estimations.

## What would be the needed next steps to answer the question?

The next steps to prove the robustness of the Mincer equation would be:

- Take in consideration the culture of each society evaluated. For example, Koreans have a rigid working culture, where earnings depends, beside from years of schooling, the college of procedence and the graduate ranking.

- Use new data and check other papers that may expanded the state of knowledge.
